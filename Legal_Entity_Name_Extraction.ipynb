    "# Legal Entity Name Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Legal entity name extraction is an optimal way to identify and classify legal organization name and their aliases in an unstructured text. It can consume the texts such as legal documents and process it to identify all the legal entities/aliases in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this algorithm you need to have access to the following AWS Services:\n",
    "- Access to AWS SageMaker and the model package.\n",
    "- An S3 bucket to specify input/output.\n",
    "- Role for AWS SageMaker to access input/output from S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample notebook shows you how to deploy Legal Entity Name Extraction using Amazon SageMaker.\n",
